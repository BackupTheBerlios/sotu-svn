  <Char_Desc_450>Scum of the Universe is a game that combines two genres: arcade and strategy. On one side, it's a classic vertical-scrolling 3rd person shooter game. On the other side, it is an adventure and strategy. You should choose whether you'll be an independent space trader, firearms smuggler, fierce freedom-fighter or something in between. Following the main storyline, you go through the galaxy from one planet to another.</Char_Desc_450>
  <Char_Desc_2000>Scum of the Universe is a game that combines two genres: arcade and strategy. On one side, it's a classic vertical-scrolling 3rd person shooter game. On the other side, it is an adventure and strategy. You should choose whether you'll be an independent space trader, firearms smuggler, fierce freedom-fighter or something in between. Following the main storyline, you go through the galaxy from one planet to another. Space travel requires fuel, so you need to keep earning money to buy it. You can also buy various upgrades for your spaceship and weapons that affect the arcade part of the game. The storyline itself is not linear. There are also some points where you'll need to make decisions that will determine your destiny.</Char_Desc_2000>
