The atime and noatime attribute

Linux records information about when files were created and last modified as well as when it was last accessed. There is a cost associated with recording the last access time. The ext2 file system of Linux has an attribute that allows the super-user to mark individual files such that their last access time is not recorded. This may lead to significant performance improvements on often accessed frequently changing files such as the contents of the /var/spool/news directory.

 To set the attribute to a file, use:

           [root@deep] /#chattr +A filename  (1)

 For a whole directory tree, do something like:

           [root@deep /root]#chattr -R +A  /var/spool/    (1)
           [root@deep /root]#chattr -R +A  /cache/        (2)
           [root@deep /root]#chattr -R +A /home/httpd/ona/   (3)

 Linux has a special mount option for file systems called noatime that can be added to each line that addresses one file system in the /etc/fstab file. If a file system has been mounted with this option, reading accesses to the file system will no longer result in an update to the atime information associated with the file like we have explained above. The importance of the noatime setting is that it eliminates the need by the system to make writes to the file system for files which are simply being read. Since writes can be somewhat expensive, this can result in measurable performance gains. Note that the write time information to a file will continue to be updated anytime the file is written to. In our example below, we will set the noatime option to our /chroot file system.

Edit the fstab file vi /etc/fstab and add in the line that refer to /chrootfile system the noatime option after the defaults option as show below:

            /dev/sda7          /chroot          ext2          defaults,noatime          1  2


You need not reboot your system for the change to take effect, just make the Linux system aware about the modification you have made to the /etc/fstab file. This can be accomplished with the following commands:

           [root@deep] /#mount -oremount /chroot/


Then test your results with the flowing command:

           [root@deep]# cat /proc/mounts


/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0 /proc /proc proc rw 0 0 /dev/sda1 /boot ext2 rw 0 0 /dev/sda8 /cache ext2 rw 0 0 /dev/sda7 /chroot ext2 rw,noatime 0 0 /dev/sda6 /home ext2 rw 0 0 /dev/sda11 /tmp ext2 rw 0 0 /dev/sda5 /usr ext2 rw 0 0 /dev/sda9 /var ext2 rw 0 0 none /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
If you see something like: /dev/sda7 /chroot ext2 rw,noatime 0 0, congratulations!

3. 6.12. Tuning IDE Hard Disk Performance

Putting your swap partitions near the beginning of your drive, see
may give you some acceptable improvement.
The beginning of the drive is physically located on the outer portion
of the cylinder, and the read/write head can cover much more ground
per revolution. We typically see partitions placed at the end of the drive
work 3MB/s slower using the hdparm -t command.

Performance increases have been reported on massive disk I/O operations
by setting the IDE drivers to use DMA, 32-bit transfers and multiple
sector modes. The kernel seems to use more conservative settings unless
told otherwise. The magic command to change the setting of your drive is
hdparm. To enable 32-bit I/O over the PCI buses, use the command:

[root@deep] /# /sbin/hdparm -c1 /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.


This will usually, depending on your IDE Disk Drive model, cut the timing
buffered disk reads time by 2. The hdparm(8) manpage says that you may
need to use -c 3 for some chipsets. All (E)IDE drives still have only a
16-bit connection over the ribbon cable from the interface card.
To enable DMA, use the command:

[root@deep] /# /sbin/hdparm -d1 /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.

This may depend on support for your motherboard chipset being compiled
into your kernel. Also, this command will enable DMA support for your
hard drive, it will cut the timing buffered disk reads time and will
improve the performance by 2. To enable multiword DMA mode 2 transfers,
use the command:

[root@deep] /#/sbin/hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.


This sets the IDE transfer mode for newer (E)IDE/ATA2 drives. check
your hardware manual to see if you have it. To enable UltraDMA
mode2 transfers, use the command:

[root@deep] /# /sbin/hdparm -d1 -X66 /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.


You'll need to prepare the chipset for UltraDMA beforehand. Also,
see your manual page about hdparm for more information. Use this with
extreme caution! To set multiple sector mode I/O, use the command:

[root@deep] /#/sbin/hdparm -m XX /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.


Where XX is the maximum setting supported by your drive. The -i flag
can be used to find the maximum setting supported by an installed
drive: look for MaxMultSect in the output.

[root@deep] /#/sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.

 /dev/hda:

 Model=Maxtor 7540 AV, FwRev=GA7X4647, SerialNo=L1007YZS
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>5Mbs FmtGapReq }
 RawCHS=1046/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=11
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=32kB, MaxMultSect=8, MultSect=8
 DblWordIO=yes, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=1(medium)
 CurCHS=523/32/63, CurSects=379584528, LBA=yes, LBA=yes, LBAsects=1054368
 tDMA={min:150,rec:150}, DMA modes: sword0 sword1 *sword2 *mword0
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:180}, PIO modes: mode3



Multiple sector mode aka IDE Block Mode, is a feature of most modern IDE
hard drives, permitting the transfer of multiple sectors per I/O
interrupt, rather than the usual one sector per interrupt. When this
feature is enabled, it typically reduces operating system overhead for
disk I/O by 30-50%. On many systems it also provides increased data
throughput of anywhere from 5% to 50%. You can test the results of your
changes by running hdparm in performance test mode:

 [root@deep] /#/sbin/hdparm -t /dev/hda or hdb, hdc etc.


Tip: Once you have a set of hdparm options, you can put the commands
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file to run it every time you reboot the machine.

4. Optimize the network

6.13. Better manage your TCP/IP resources

This hack just make the time default values for TCP/IP connection lower so that more connections can be handled by time on your TCP/IP protocol. The following will decrease the amount of time your Linux box will try take to finish closing a connection and the amount of time before it will kill a stale connection. This will also turn off some IP extensions that aren't needed. The default setup for the TCP/IP parameters we'll change under Red Hat Linux are:

    *

      For the tcp_fin_timeout 180
    *

      For the tcp_keepalive_time 7200
    *

      For the tcp_window_scaling 1
    *

      For the tcp_sack 1
    *

      For the tcp_timestamps 1

To adjust the new TCP/IP values, type the following commands on your terminal:

             [root@deep] /#echo 30 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout
             [root@deep] /#echo 1800 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time
             [root@deep] /#echo 0  >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling
             [root@deep] /#echo 0  >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack
             [root@deep] /#echo 0  >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps


Execute the above commands and put them in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file so you don't need to type them again each time your system reboots.

Version 6.2 only
Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file and add the following lines:

             # Decrease the time default value for tcp_fin_timeout connection
             net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30
             # Decrease the time default value for tcp_keepalive_time connection
             net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 1800
             # Turn off the tcp_window_scaling
             net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0
             # Turn off the tcp_sack
             net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 0
             # Turn off the tcp_timestamps
             net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0


You must restart your network for the change to take effect. The command to manually restart the network is the following:

             [root@deep] /# /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Classic server and (x)inetd.conf

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.

The file-max parameter

The file-max file /proc/sys/fs/file-max sets the maximum number of file-handles that the
Linux kernel will allocate. We generally tune this file to improve the number of
open files by increasing the value of /proc/sys/fs/file-max to something reasonable
like 256 for every 4M of RAM we have: i.e. for a machine with 128 MB of RAM, set
it to 8192 - 128/4=32 32*256=8192.


 The default setup for the file-max parameter under Red Hat Linux is:  "4096"  To adjust the value of file-max to 128 MB of RAM, type the following on your terminal:

Version 6.1 only

          [root@deep] /# echo "8192" >/proc/sys/fs/file-max


Add the above commands to the /etc/rc.d/rc.local script file and you'll not have to type it again the next time your server reboots.

Version 6.2 only
Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file and add the following line:

          # Improve the number of open files
          fs.file-max = 8192


You must restart your network for the change to take effect. The command to manually restart the network is the following:

          [root@deep] /# /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart


10.

 Linux itself has a Max Processes per user limit. This feature allows us to control the number of processes an existing user on the server may be authorized to have. To improve performance, we can safely set the limit of processes for the super-user root to be unlimited. Edit the .bashrc file vi /root/.bashrc and add the following line:

          ulimit -u unlimited


You must exit and re-login from your terminal for the change to take effect.

          [root@deep] /# ulimit -a


          core file size (blocks)   1000000
          data seg size (kbytes)    unlimited
          file size (blocks)            unlimited
          max memory size (kbytes)  unlimited
          stack size (kbytes)           8192
          cpu time (seconds)            unlimited
          max user processes            unlimited  (1)
          pipe size (512 bytes)         8
          open files                    1024
          virtual memory (kbytes)   2105343


(1)
    Make sure that when you type as root the command ulimit -a on your terminal, it shows unlimited next to max user processes.

    Tip: You may also do ulimit -u unlimited at the command prompt instead of adding it to the /root/.bashrc file.

Increases the system limit on open files for instance a process on Red Hat 6.0 with kernel 2.2.5 could open at least 31000 file descriptors this way and a process on kernel 2.2.12 can open at least 90000 file descriptors this way. The upper bound seems to be available memory. To increases the number of open files to 90000 for the root account do the following: Edit the .bashrc file vi /root/.bashrc and add the following line:

          ulimit -n 90000


You must exit from your terminal and re-login for the change to take effect.

          [root@deep] /# ulimit -a


          core file size (blocks)   1000000
          data seg size (kbytes)    unlimited
          file size (blocks)            unlimited
          max memory size (kbytes)  unlimited
          stack size (kbytes)           8192
          cpu time (seconds)            unlimited
          max user processes            unlimited
          pipe size (512 bytes)         8
          open files                    90000   (1)
          virtual memory (kbytes)   2105343


(1)
    Make sure that when you type as root the command ulimit -a on your terminal, it shows 90000 next to open files.

    Note: In older 2.2 kernels, though, the number of open files per process is still limited to 1024, even with the above changes.
