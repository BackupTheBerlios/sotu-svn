H1:Cross-platform options for desktop applications

When you install Firebird, you get the database engine and a set of tools that let you administer it. For users to efficiently access the database you need a "desktop" application. Firebird has C API available out of the box. However, there is an abundance of 3rd party interfaces for various programming languages and development environments. This paper concentrates on libraries and tools that allow user to create desktop applications that would run on multiple operating systems without (or with minimum) changes to the code. Here are the various toolkits and programming languages that are viable options today:

H2: Java + JDBC

Java is an object-oriented programming language, well proven in enterprise area. It is portable to various operating systems (Windows, Linux, Solaris, etc.) and hardware (Intel, Sparc, PowerPC). Java is semi-interpreted. The source code is first compiled into byte-code, and later run by Java virtual machine. For desktop applications it offers various toolkits like Swing and AWT. For database connectivity, there is a standard called JDBC, and there is suitable driver for Firebird called JayBird. Java is surely one of the options anyone should consider. It is easy to find programmers that know it, and the language itself has proven stable and robust. The main problem with Java shows when you want to run in on low-end hardware, as it has much bigger demands for memory and CPU power than the equivallent C++ application. Java is free as in beer, and there are even talks that Sun might open source the Java code soon.

H2: Python (wxPython + kinterbasd)

Python is also an object-oriented language, with looser typing and more flexibility. Python is also compiled into bytecode (.pyc files) and then run. Interesting thing is that Python has been ported to Java and .Net virtual machines. It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2, etc. Python is very interesting option as wxWidgets library is ported to Python (and called wxPython). Beside that, there are bindings for other popular GUI libraries like PyQt and PyGtk. For database connectivity, Python uses the "Python Database API". For Firebird there is a Python Database API 2.0-compliant driver called kinterbasdb. Python suffers from same problems as Java on low-end and older hardware. Python is an open-source project released under The Python License, which allows you to distribute your commercial applications without releasing the source code.

H2: C++

C++ is another object-oriented language. The main difference compared to Java and Python is that C++ compiler creates native executable files (programs). This makes them run much faster with less memory demand. C++ is ported to many (all?) platforms that exist today. There are various compilers available. Some are open source and run on multiple platforms (like GCC for example). Others are either closed-source or freeware and usually tied to a single platform. To name some compilers: Microsoft Visual C++, Borland C++, Digital Mars C++, Intel C++, Bloodshed Dev-C++, Apple C++. Good thing about C++ is that you could write code and compile with one compiler on one platform and with different compiler on another, whichever suits you best. However, the graphics systems (desktop environments) are different on each platform and have a different API. That's why we need wrapper libraries in order to "write once, run everywhere":

H3: Qt

Qt is a library developed by Trolltech. It has a rich collection of classes that allow GUI programming. Qt is available on Windows, Mac OS X and platforms that run X11 server (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, IRIX, AIX and many other Unix variants). Qt uses the window it gets from the host system to draw all the controls itself. That's why Qt applications don't look native, but they look the same on all the platforms. However, Qt offers "theming", so developers can create custom look of controls and windows. 

Qt is dual licensed. Open source projects can used open sourced version, while closed source projects have to pay licenses. This makes Qt less attractive then other options to developers of commercial applications. On the other hand, Qt is used by the KDE Desktop Environment which is default on many Linux distributions, and has proven that it is fast, robust and reliable library with low memory requirements. Many people don't see KDE as such, which is because of layer of KDE libraries built upon Qt. Pure Qt applications (like LinCVS for example) run lightningly fast.

To design forms, you can use Qt Designer, and there is excellent IDE called KDevelop. KDevelop is part of the KDE, so it is currently not available on Windows.

H3: Gtk+

Gtk+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. It started as a toolkit for The Gimp (GNU Image Manipulation Program), but became so good that entire desktop environments (Gnome) are built on it. Same as with Qt, Gtk renders (draws) all of its controls on window given by the host system (Windows or X11). Gtk is written in C, which is one drawback compared to Qt: as C++ exceptions cannot propagate through C code, you have to be very careful not to throw C++ exceptions from asynchronous event-handling functions. Gtk comes in two versions Gtk1 and Gtk2. Gtk1 is an older library with limited set of widgets. However, it is really fast and low memory requirements. It is suitable for low-end machines and applications where eye-candy is not an important issue. Gtk2 is a modern set of widgets and it allows theming and has Unicode support. Important thing about Gtk1 is that is has much less dependencies, so it is easier to install and maintain. If we compare Qt and Gtk, one can say that Qt works as fast as Gtk1 and looks as good as Gtk2 on screen.

Gtk is an open-source library, released under LGPL license. This allows anyone to build commercial applications without having to pay or release the source code. Beside that, many people choose Gtk as it looks native on Gnome which is the default desktop environment on RedHat/Fedora and Ubuntu, two among leading Linux distributions. Works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and should work on any platform where you have X11 window system and GNU GCC compiler available.

To design forms, you can use Glade, which is a standard builder for Gtk applications.

H3: wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a cross-platform toolkit that exists for more than ten years and provides ports to many platforms. It's uncommon in sense that it wraps around native toolkit on a platform instead of drawing all the controls itself. On Windows it uses the Windows API. On Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris it gives option between Gtk (both Gtk1 and Gtk2), motif and X11. On Mac OS X it uses Carbon, and Cocoa port is on the way. All this makes the applications using it look and feel native on each platform. In
fact, those are native applications, which just use the additional layer that makes platform differences almost transparent. All this make easier for users to accept the application, since everything looks familiar.

Beside basic graphic widgets, wxWidgets also offers various components needed in application development like: clipboard support, drag and drop, multi-threading, image loading and saving in various formats, HTML viewing support, printing, etc. All of those wrap a native way to do it on each platform. If something is missing, wxWidgets provide their own replacement if possible. Good example of this is tree widget on Gtk1, which Gtk1 does not provide, so wxWidgets draw their own generic version of the control.

In most cases, when working with wxWidgets, you don't have to care which platform the code it written for. For example, Gtk1 is partly compatible with Gtk2 so some applications can be compiled against both libraries. wxWidgets introduces a set of #ifdefs that mark the different parts, so programmers don't have to pay much attention and simply pick the one they want. Some of the widgets that don't exist in Gtk1 are emulated by wxWidgets. With wxWidgets, you first build the wxWidgets library against desired toolkit (WindowsAPI, Gtk1, Gtk2, X11, Motif, Carbon, etc.) and then you link your application against wxWidgets library. In most cases you don't need to change code at all in order to work on different platform.

wxWidgets can be built with various compilers. At FlameRobin project, we are successfully using GNU GCC and Microsoft Visual C++ from the very beginning. You can also use GCC on Windows using MinGW environment. Borland's Free C++ Compiler is also very good for smaller projects, while linker sometimes chokes when project gets really big (100+ units). It can also be built with DJGPP, DigitalMars, CodeWarrior, Sun CC, Symantec C++, Watcom C++, IBM Visual Age and AIX Compiler (xlc), although these are not extensively tested.

There are various closed and open source applications that allow you to design wxWidgets forms:

H4: wxFormBuilder 

wxFormBuilder is an open source tool written in C++ using wxWidgets itself. It still young but already very powerful. It is a pure form designer, without support to edit event handlers. However, it is really fast and robust. Newer versions have all the common widgets available in it, and even some contributed ones.

http://www.wxformbuilder.org/

H4: wxGlade 

wxGlade is an open source form designer written in wxPython (so it works on all platforms supported by wxWidgets). It was one of the first free tools to offer quality editing, but development is slow. It marks the places in code where developers should, and where they shouldn't write their code. It does not create event handlers automatically.

http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/

H4: wxDesigner

wxDesigner is a commercial form designer. It is one of the most complete tools, allowing you to build and test dialogs and write code for event handlers. Event handlers are not as easy as Delphi's double-click the control, but it is still quite usable and much easier than adding those by hand. It also features built-in editor, so it can almost be used as IDE (there are no options to compile, run, debug the code).

http://www.roebling.de/

H4: VisualVx

VisualVx is a freeware form designer and a RAD tool. It supports event handlers. The tool is Windows-only and doesn't work on other platforms. The main problem is that the code it generates is somewhat hard for humans to read as it has too many code guards and makes obscure variable names.

H1:Cross-platform options for C/C++ access to Firebird

H2: ODBC

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is an industry standard way for accessing database management systems. There are ODBC implementations for various operating systems: Microsoft ODBC for Windows, UnixODBC for Linux/UNIX, iODBC for Mac, Solaris, FreeBSD, etc. To access database from application, wxWidgets provide wxODBC set of classes:

http://www.wxwidgets.org/wiki/index.php/ODBC

In case you don't use wxWidgets, there is libodbc++ library:

http://libodbcxx.sourceforge.net/

As for Firebird, there are various ODBC drivers, some open source (like the one supplied by the project) and some commercial. The quality and features differ, so better try it out before going deep into development.

http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files&id=odbc

ODBC is great if you need to access other non-Firebird databases. However, supporting many DBMSes meant it covers the lowest common denominator, so most of the advanced stuff (things provided by Firebird's Services API) is not available. Also, ODBC seems much thicker layer around Firebird C API than lightweight IBPP.

H2: C API (good, but complex and error prone)

Firebird C API comes with default instalation. There are even examples in "examples" directory. This is the fastest and most efficient way to access the database. However, it is also the most complex and thus most error prone. C API is useful if you don't want to depend on C++ library and compiler, especially if you're building a driver for other programming languages. But, if you're building a C++ desktop application, IBPP is much better option...

H2: IBPP 

IBPP is a thin C++ wrapper around Firebird C API. It is not a simple translation of functions from C to C++, but rather nice object-oriented interface to database features. IBPP offers full access to all Firebird's functions, so you can create, drop, backup, restore and fix databases, manage users, etc. IBPP is easily integrated into your applications, and highly portable: works on Windows, Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and probably more. The library itself uses standard C++, so you don't need to install anything else.

IBPP is currently Firebird-only, so you're locked into Firebird if you decide to use it. One of the great advantages over C API is also that you're safe from API change. If some future versions of Firebird decide to change the C API (which is not likely, but still) you don't need to change your code as the changes would be done in IBPP itself.

IBPP has an open-source license, which is very simple and allows the use of IBPP in both open and closed-source projects without any drawbacks.

Author note: My experience with IBPP has been excellent. I'm using it since 2002 in various commercial and open source projects. It has proven to be rock-solid and support from lead developer Olivier Mascia is great.

http://www.ibpp.org/


H2: SQLAPI++

SQLAPI++ is an interesting option. It's a wrapper similar to IBPP, but it can be used against different database systems (Firebird, Oracle, MSSQL, Sybase, DB2, MySQL, etc.). The main problem is that Firebird specific functions (like creating database for example) are left for developer to implement in native C API. Just like with ODBC, you get multiple DBMS support, but you're cut off from functions offered by Firebird's Services API. SQLAPI++ is shareware, priced at $249 at the time of writing.

H2: DatabaseLayer

Some time ago, an interesting project has been started to provide native access to various DBMS systems from wxWidgets. This is a nice alternative to wxODBC. It currently supports Firebird, MySQL, Postgresql and SQLite. You can also hook up and ODBC data source to it. Once more, there is no interface to Services API. DatabaseLayer is an open source project, released under same license as wxWidgets.

H1: Setting up wxWidgets application with Firebird support (IBPP)

In the past, setting up wxWidgets builds was a matter of manual setup of makefiles. While it is still possible today, it's a tedious process, especially if your project has a lot of files and you build on multiple platforms. Since version 2.6 of wxWidgets, a new build system was introduced. It is called Bakefile, and although it's primary purpose is to serve wxWidgets development, it is a standalone open source project:

http://bakefile.sourceforge.net

Bakefile allows you to maintain a single definition file for all platforms and compilers. Simply edit the textual (xml-like) definition file and add your source files (.cpp/.h), resource files (icons and stuff) and installation files (files and directories that need to be installed with you application). Bakefile uses this definition file (which has .bkl extension) to create makefiles for various compilers, and also project files for MSVC. 

Setting up bakefile build system for your own projects in not an easy task. The only real example you have is build system used for wxWidgets, but it is somewhat specific as it is oriented around building the library instead of building an application. Based on our experience with FlameRobin, we created a minimal Bakefile-based build system for anyone who wants to build wxWidgets application and use IBPP to access Firebird from it. This system shares FlameRobin license: Expat, also known as MIT. It's a BSD style license and basically it means that you can take all the code, do whatever you want with it, use it in either open or close sourced project, and you don't have to give anything back (neither code or money). The only requirement is that you keep our copyright notice in files. Of course, for you own files and modifications you make, you can put whichever license you wish.

Minimal build system is available from FlameRobin Subversion repository. You can fetch it with:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/flamerobin/trunk/template-project

Once you download it, read HOWTO.txt for step-by-step setup. 

This is just a starting point, and now you can add your own files. Beside minimal system, entire FlameRobin source code available, so you can learn how to do some things, and you can even take some ready-made classes and functions and shorten the time needed to build the Firebird-based application. There are also plans to reduce the dependencies of some FlameRobin classes on others, so you could, for example, take ready-made DataGrid class without having to include 5-10 other files from the project.



H1: Comparison with Delphi

Delphi is a well known tool that set up a standard for rapid application development (RAD). It is a tool that most Firebird developers are using when developing desktop applications. Therefore, Delphi is a very good reference point to compare any other alternative with.

******** TODO: probati CodeBlocks prvo
    - single integrated tool vs many separate specialized tools
    - .dfm files: .xml turns into .xrc or .cpp

H2: No properties

Unlike C++ Builder, wxWidgets are pure C++, so there aren't any non-standard extensions like Borland's properties. You have to use GetXXX/SetXXX methods to access class data.

H2: Event macros vs Delphi's RAD approach


H2: Data aware controls

IBPP is a thin C++ access layer. This means that you have classes like Database, Transaction and Statement, but there are no advanced concepts like Dataset or data-aware GUI controls. This means that more things have to be programmed by the developer.

H1: Solving typical problems:
    - fatal exception handling
    - conversion between string types
    - layout (styleguide classes)
    - thinking in cross-platform way (what is abstracted and what is not)
        - sizers instead of fixed coordinates (reasons to use them)
        - paths
        - fonts
        - colors
        - screen (displays)
        - etc.

H1: Conclusion

If plan to develop database applications that need to run on multiple platforms, wxWidgets is one of the best choices available. It is robust, scalable and has much lower memory and CPU power requirements than most other alternatives. It is still not a the RAD level of Delphi, but you get cross-platform functionality for free, so it isn't hard to put in a little bit more effort. Being open source and having a lot of active developers for over ten years shows that this framework would not become obsolete as happened to many others which were bound to a single platform or a single company.
